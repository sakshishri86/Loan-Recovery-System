# Loan Recovery Strategy Analysis

### Case Study

A financial institution provides various types of loans and is facing challenges in loan recovery. The institution has observed a significant increase in delinquent loans, particularly in borrowers who have missed multiple payments. The management wants to optimize the loan recovery process by identifying the best strategies based on borrower profiles, outstanding loan amounts, and past recovery outcomes.

Using historical data, your task is to develop a Loan Recovery Strategy Model that predicts each delinquent borrowerâ€™s most effective recovery method to maximize loan recovery while minimizing costs.

Here are the problems you need to solve:

*   Identify borrower segments based on attributes such as loan amount, monthly income, payment history, and missed payments.
*   Optimize collection methods (e.g., legal action, settlement offers, debt collectors, phone calls) to increase recovery rates.
*   Minimize recovery costs while maximizing the amount recovered.
*   Develop an early warning system to flag borrowers who are at high risk of default.
